  "summary": "Core pages, navigation, inquiry form UI, admin inquiry list/details, and a Motoko backend with create/list/get inquiry methods were added. However, some BuildRequest requirements appear unmet or mismatched (notably inquiry form field rules, theme color constraint, and confirmation that required generated image files were added). Several extra features (user profiles, multiple message types, secret-token access-control initialization, and caffeine.ai branding) appear beyond the requested scope.",
