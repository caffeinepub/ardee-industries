# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Remove all public-facing uses of the word “recycling” and add warehouse location copy for Wada MIDC.

**Planned changes:**
- Update marketing/UI copy across public pages (Home, About, Trading, Contact) and shared layout components to remove the word “recycling” while preserving the intended meaning.
- Add the exact sentence “We have a warehouse in Wada MIDC” in a visible location on the Contact page (contact information area), with optional inclusion in shared company info (e.g., footer) for consistency.

**User-visible outcome:** Public pages no longer contain the word “recycling”, and visitors can see “We have a warehouse in Wada MIDC” on the Contact page without logging in.
